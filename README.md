## Node.js Static Site Generator

I didn't like any of the SSG's, so i decided to create my own

This fella comes with a esj templating, markdown file reading, and a livereload server for dev mode.

It builds all the html content to the ./dist folder, and copy the assets on a public folder to the dist as well.

Feel free to clone it, fork it ou just scratch the code to find some solutions. ðŸ’¯

## Usage

To build:

`npm run build`

To serve:

`npm run serve`

Simple as that.
